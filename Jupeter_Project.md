## What Type of Project is this?
1. Science
2. Boda Chen
3. Project Title: Investigating the Magnetic Fields of Jupiter

## Rationale
1. Rationale: Jupiter is known to have the strongest magnetic field in our solar
   system, with a field strength about 20,000 times stronger than Earth's.
   However, the factors that contribute to the strength and variability of
   Jupiter's magnetic field are not well understood. Investigating the magnetic
   fields of Jupiter can help us better understand the dynamics of the planet's
   interior and atmosphere, and provide insights into the processes that shape
   the evolution of gas giant planets in general.
2. Background Research: Scientists have been studying Jupiter's magnetic field
   for several decades, using data from spacecraft missions and ground-based
   observations. Early observations revealed that Jupiter has a strong and
   complex magnetic field, with regions of both strong and weak field strength.
   More recent observations have shown that Jupiter's magnetic field is highly
   variable, with the magnetic field strength changing rapidly over time. There
   are several theories that attempt to explain the factors that contribute to
   the variability and strength of Jupiter's magnetic field, such as the
   planet's rapid rotation rate and its metallic hydrogen core.
3. Importance and Impact: Investigating the magnetic fields of Jupiter is
   important because it can provide insights into the fundamental processes that
   govern the evolution of gas giant planets in our solar system and beyond.
   Understanding the magnetic fields of gas giant planets is crucial for future
   space exploration missions, as it can help us better understand the hazards
   and challenges associated with exploring these planets. Additionally,
   understanding the magnetic fields of gas giant planets can provide insights
   into the magnetic fields of other planets and celestial bodies, such as
   exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Overall, investigating the magnetic fields of
   Jupiter has the potential to expand our understanding of the universe and
   provide practical applications for space exploration and science.

## Question/Problem
1. How does the strength of Jupiter's magnetic field vary over time, and what
   factors contribute to this variability?
2. How does the shape of Jupiter's magnetic field change with changes in the
   planet's atmosphere, such as the appearance or disappearance of atmospheric
   features like the Great Red Spot?

## Variables
1. Independent Variable:
  * Atmospheric features (e.g. the Great Red Spot)
2. Dependent Variable:
  * Magnetic field strength
  * Magnetic field shape
3. Controlled Variables:
  * Time
  * Location
  * Distance from Jupiter
  * Instrument used to measure magnetic field strength and shape
4. Control Group:
  * None

## Hypothesis/Engineering Goal/Expected outcome
1. Hypothesis: Based on previous research and observations, we hypothesize that
   changes in Jupiter's atmosphere, such as the appearance or disappearance of
   storms or other features, will affect the shape and strength of the planet's
   magnetic field. Specifically, we expect that changes in the atmospheric
   dynamics will cause variations in the magnetic field strength and direction,
   which may be detectable through analysis of the data.
2. Expected Outcomes: If our hypothesis is correct, we expect to observe changes
   in the strength and shape of Jupiter's magnetic field over time in response
   to changes in the planet's atmosphere. These changes may be detectable
   through analysis of the data gathered from spacecraft missions and
   ground-based observations. Additionally, we expect to identify the specific
   atmospheric features or dynamics that have the most significant effect on the
   magnetic field, which can provide insights into the physical processes that
   drive the variability of Jupiter's magnetic field.
3. Overall, the expected outcomes of this project are to gain a better
   understanding of the complex and dynamic magnetic field of Jupiter, and to
   identify the factors that contribute to its variability and changes over
   time. This knowledge can be useful for future space exploration missions and
   for understanding the formation and evolution of gas giant planets.
